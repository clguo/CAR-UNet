# [Channel Attention Residual U-Net for Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08829)
This code is for the paper: Channel Attention Residual U-Net for Retinal Vessel Segmentation. We report state-of-the-art performances on DRIVE, CHASE DB1 and STARE datasets.

Code written by Changlu Guo, Budapest University of Technology and Economics(BME).


We train and evaluate on Ubuntu 16.04, it will also work for Windows and OS.

## Quick start 

Train:
Run train_drive.py or train_chase.py <br>
or tarin_stare.py(4-fold cross-validation)

Test:
Run eval_drive.py or eval_chase.py

## Results

## Environments
Keras 2.3.1  <br>
Tensorflow==1.14.0 <br>
